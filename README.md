# asdf-java

[Java](https://www.java.com/en/) plugin for the [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) version manager.

## Why this repository

This repository is mostly based on the official [asdf-java](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java).
Because in China, the download speed for AdoptOpenJDK is very slow. So I just
change the final download link to [TUNA mirror](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/AdoptOpenJDK).
This is only useful for China users, and the code changes are a bit invaded, so
it's better to keep these changes in the forked repository.

## Requirements
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
- [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)
- [sha256sum](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)

## Install

```
asdf plugin-add java https://github.com/uzxmx/asdf-java.git
```

## Use

Check [asdf](https://asdf-vm.github.io/asdf/) for instructions on how to install & manage versions of Java.

## Install

List candidate JDKs:

`asdf list-all java`

Install a candidate listed from the previous command like this:

`asdf install java adopt-openjdk-12.0.2+10.2`

Select an installed candidate for use like this:

`asdf global java adopt-openjdk-12.0.2+10.2`

## JAVA_HOME

I do not recommend the [way](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java#java_home) as the official says,
because that may slow your shell startup speed. Instead, I recommend adding
below line to your shell rc file explicitly.

```sh
export JAVA_HOME=~/.asdf/installs/java/YOUR_JDK_VERSION
```

Change YOUR_JDK_VERSION to the correct value. Remember to update it whenever
you want to change to a different JDK version.
